# godot-quake-movement
An attempt at replicating quake movement in Godot (WIP / Incomplete)

Video demonstration :

The movement code is located in [Player.gd](Player.gd)

A few notes :

- **All features are not implemented, such as going up steps.**

# Warning

This work was adapted from various sources found on the internet. As I haven't really invented anything, I can not (nor do I want to) restrict the use of any part of this project. As far as I'm aware, none of the sources I used prohibited redistribution or modification. However, I can not guarantee it...

I am very much a beginner at Godot, game programming and programming in general.

I can not gurantee in any way that this code is of acceptable quality, nor that it works.

You should keep this in mind if you want to use this in your own project !

To summarize, feel free to use this, but do so at your own risk !

A number of resources on the internet were used to create this. The most important ones being :

[Bunnyhopping from the Programmer's Perspective (by Adrian Biagioli)](https://adrianb.io/2015/02/14/bunnyhop.html)

The displaying of vectors was taken directly from :

While not consulted for the development of this project, I recently stumbled upon this resource which further explains Quake's movement code :
